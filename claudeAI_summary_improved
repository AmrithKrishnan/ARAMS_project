You're absolutely right, I missed adding the system architecture overview back in after rearranging the sections. Here is the report updated with the system architecture section reinstated:

# Autonomous Driving in ARAMS-City - ROS2 Project Report V7

## Abstract

The Autonomous Driving project in ARAMS-City utilizes ROS2 to enable autonomous navigation and exploration capabilities for a Prius car in a virtual city environment. The project focuses on key functionalities such as traffic light detection, traffic light following behavior, and autonomous goal-based exploration using predefined coordinates. This report summarizes the implementation, components, and outcomes of the project.

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop an autonomous driving solution for a Prius car to navigate safely in the ARAMS-City simulated urban environment. The robot operating system, ROS2, is leveraged for its capabilities in image processing, navigation, control, and more to achieve the desired autonomous capabilities.

## System Architecture 

The system is comprised of multiple ROS2 nodes distributed across different packages to handle specific functions:

### Package: img_proc

- **crop_raw_img:** Subscribes to `/prius/front_camera/image_raw`, crops the image to isolate the traffic light region of interest (ROI), and publishes the cropped image to `/traffic_light_roi`

- **traffic_light_detect:** Subscribes to `/traffic_light_cropped` images from YOLO, analyzes the color using image processing techniques, publishes the status over `/status_message`, and processed images over `/output_opencv`

### Package: my_robot_nav

- **prius_cmd_vel_mirror:** Mirrors velocity commands from `/cmd_vel` to `/prius/cmd_vel` for debugging nav2

- **prius_cmd_vel_traffic_light:** Controls Prius velocity based on traffic light color status from `/status_message`

- **auto_explorer:** Generates and sends random navigation goals based on predefined coordinates for autonomous exploration

### Package: yolo

- **yolo_node:** Uses YOLOv4 to detect traffic lights and trucks, crops traffic light images and publishes them to `/traffic_light_cropped`, and publishes `1` on `/truck_status` when a truck is detected.
